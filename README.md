# ActiveLLM

This repository provides an implementation of **ActiveLLM**, a large language model based active learning approach for textual few-shot scenarios as described in the accompanying paper.

The code is organised as a Python package under `active-ic-llm` and contains scripts for dataset preparation, running experiments with different active learning strategies and models, and utilities for embeddings and clustering.

See `active-ic-llm/README.md` for details on how to install dependencies, prepare data and reproduce the experiments.
